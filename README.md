This is a place to store my customized linux menus since they are such a pain to redo when you switch from one distro to another or want to add an additional distro while keeping some of the menu customizations you already set up once.

I liked the setup from Ubuntu Studio for video, graphics, audio especially and copied those.  I also set up a bunch of new ones for Ham radio related stuff since I wanted these grouped more like the way Andy did his on the Andy's Ham Radio Linux distro, but he didn't implement using the freedesktop.org standards so I had to create my own instead of borrowing his.

I also liked the menus on Parrot Security OS so I utilized those too.  Menus here were a lot easier to duplicate since they followed the freedesktop standard, I was able to get the menu files directly instead of having to create them from scratch.  They also had a couple basic shells to use to call packages that have to run as root that I liked and used (one for cmd line and one for graphical programs, menuexec and menuexecg).  I used Parrot's desktop files for the apps too, as they already had the parrot categories and the shells being called.  Each time I install one of the apps from parrot I copy over the .dekstop file for that program rather than keeping the default installed with the program.

I'll add more details to this later, just wanting to get these backed up for now.  


You can look at the shell if you want to know what directories I had these various files located.  Note that you can also put these into user specific folders in your home directory if you want.

This is a place to store my customized linux menus since they are such a pain to redo when you switch from one distro to another or want to add an additional distro while keeping some of the menu customizations you already set up once.

I liked the setup from Ubuntu Studio for video, graphics, audio especially and copied those.  I also set up a bunch of new ones for Ham radio related stuff since I wanted these grouped more like the way Andy did his on the Andy's Ham Radio Linux distro, but he didn't implement using the freedesktop.org standards so I had to create my own instead of borrowing his.


I'll add more details to this later, just wanting to get these backed up for now.

You can look at the shell if you want to know what directories I had these various files located.  Note that you can also put these into user specific folders in your home directory if you want.
